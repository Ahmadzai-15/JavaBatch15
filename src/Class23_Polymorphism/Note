            Method-overriding happens when same method with different implementation exists in parent and child
            class.
        Why should we override a method:
            1)Flexibility.
            when we inherit from a class and if we don't like some methods we can modify them.
        Rules:
            1) private methods and constructor can't b overridden because they don't participate in inheritance.
            2) If we want to override something we must recreate that exact method inside the child class and can
            have a different implementations only access modifier can be different. it can have more visibility then
            the method inside the parent class.
        Note:
            1) Right click in editor inside your class and click on generate-> select the fields that you want
            in your constructor and click on done.
            2) if we press ctrl+o we get an option to override the available methods.
