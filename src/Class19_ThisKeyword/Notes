            Constructor - block of code similar to a method
            that is executed when we create an Object.

            Why do we need it? - contructor initializes the object

            How to create a contructor?
            1. Construtor name MUST be same as a class
            2. No return type

            Type of the constructors:
            non argument
            parametrized

            this keyword - is used to refer to the CURRENT object

            this. can be used with variables and methods

            this. used to refer to CURRENT the instance variables
            In situation when local variable have same name as instance -> we use this. to differentiate
            and refer to the instance variable

            this can be used to refer to the CURRENT instance methods as well

            this() -can used to call CURRENT class constructor
