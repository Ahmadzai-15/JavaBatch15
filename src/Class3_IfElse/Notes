What are Variable?
    Variables are containers or boxes in the memory that can hold teh data for us.
Why we need Variables:
     Before we can ask the computer to do something for us, we need to store the information and instructions in
     a file then we feed those to the computer and computer does that thing for us.
How to create the variables(Syntax):
    1) We need to tell the computer what type of box/container/variable we need.
    2) We need to give a name to the box.
