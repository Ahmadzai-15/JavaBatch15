What is Exception?
   An Exception is unexpected/ unwanted/abnormal situation that occurred at runtime called exception.

What is Exception Handling?
    in exception handling we should have an alternative source through which we can handle the exception.
    The object oriented mechanism has provide the following techniques to work with exception.

    1- Try & catch              //Predefine exception, these are block of codes
    2- throw and throws         //User define Exception, these are keywords
    3- finally                  //its don't care about exception but it will execute always when we create finally.

1- try Block:
    in the try block we write the code which may throw an exception.
catch block:
    contains the backyup code, the code that we want to execute in case of failure. it can contain
    code to simplify the error message it can also contain the code which might send a notification or an
    email to developers or admins in case of failure.
How it works:
    We can multiple catch block with one try block. each handling a different error
    we can also put a last catch block with Exception class so that if something goes wrong and there
    is no specific catch block to handle it the exception one will handle it.

Finally block:
    Finally block is always executed no matter what happen in the try block or the catch block.
    We should put cleanup code inside the finally blocks like closing  a browser closing the
    database connection etc.
