            This keyword refers to the current class/object/instance

            Inheritance
            What it is? - process when subclass acquires properties and behavior from the super class

            Why to use it? - for code reusability, readability, eliminate code redundancy

            How to implement? - using extends keyword

            class Parent {

            }

            class Child extends Parent{

            }
            Inheritance Types:
            Single - 1 child 1 parent
            Multilevel - grandparent -> parent -> child
            Hierarchal -  1 parent multiple children

            Can a child class have multiple PARENTS? - Multiple Inheritance
                using class concept - NO

            Access Modifiers:
             4 types

             from less restrictive to the most

             public -> protected > default -> private

            Private members (variables and methods) DO NOT PARTICIPATE in the inheritance
