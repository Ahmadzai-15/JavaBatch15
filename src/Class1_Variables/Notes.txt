language to talk to a computer and that's why we need to learn java. Java is a computer language that we can
use to talk to a computer.

Important Rules of Java:
    1) All types of brackets must be in pairs if we have 10 opening brackets we must have 10 closing brackets
    as well. These are the brackets that we can use in java () {} []
    2) All java lines end with semicolon.
    3) if I want to run a java code inside a class I must have main method.

Shortcuts:
    1)type main and hit enter to create the main method.
    2) type sout and hit enter to write System.out.println()

Very Important:
    1) Always keep an eye on CourseAnnouncement channel.
    2) Always go through the slides and watch the videos that I will be sharing before every class.

 // This is main door we can't run java programs without this door
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This code will print two lines on the consoles
        // This is a side note so that if someone reads my code they can understand it easily
        System.out.println("Please don't ask me to repeat it again");
        System.out.println("Another line");
        /*
       I should use this to write multiple
       lines of code
         */

    }
}
