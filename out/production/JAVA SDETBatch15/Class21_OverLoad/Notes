            Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors.
        When we should use Super or "this" keyword:
            when ever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class. we can use super keyword to
            explicitly refer to parent class variables methods or constructors.
        Note:
            By default java prefers local variables than instance variables from the same class after that
            the instance variables or methods from the parent class.
        Method overloading.
            Method overloading happens when same name method exists in a class with different
            parameters. We can overload methods in 3 different ways.
            1) By changing the number of parameters.
            2) By changing the data types.
            3) By changing the sequence of parameters.
        Why should we overload a method or constructor?
            Clean code and flexibility to the end user.
        Some important:
            if else conditions
            loops
            arrays
            methods
            String class methods
            inheritance
