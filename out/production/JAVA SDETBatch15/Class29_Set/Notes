        Any kind of loop to performer in collection some time not working that's why we use iterator to
        perform different activities.
        Iterator:

        Sets:like HashSet,LinkedHashSet and TreeSet don't allow duplicate values.
        There are three main types of Sets
        HashSet:
            Upside:Fast
            Downside: Does not retain the insertion order
        LinkedHashset:
            Upside: Retains the insertion order.
            Downside: it's slower than HashSet.
        TreeSet:
            Upside:it keeps the data sorted Ex: 1-9, A-Z
            Downside: it's the slowest.
