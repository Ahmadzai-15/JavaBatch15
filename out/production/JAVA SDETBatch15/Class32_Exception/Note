    FileHandling:
        Reading and writing data to files is called filHandling.
        1)To read or write the data first we need to know the path or location where we will be
        reading or writing that file.
        2) We need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so that java program
        can process the data from that file. We use two classes to navigate one is called FileInputStream and
        the other one is called FileOutputStream. When we have to read the data we use FileInputStream and
        when we have to write the data we use the FileOutPutStream.
        3) We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data from that specific file
        for examples we use Properties class when we have to read tha data from the .properties file. We use
        XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from the Excel files.
    Why should we learn about FileHandling?
        1) we will be storing data like username passwords URLs type of browser etc. in configuration files.
        2) when we need to perform data driven testing we will be storing and reading all the data from files
        like xlsx or csv files.
    How To Read/write data from files
        1) Get the path
        2) use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream to navigate.
        3) use a specialized class like Properties or XSSFWorkBook.

        ==================================
        What are Exception:
        are run time issues that can stop normal flow of out programs and can abruptly terminate
        the program which is very bad and leads to bad user experience.
    Exception Handling:
        we stop the program from terminating abroutly and we try to mitigate the issue we provide
        a backup code and convert the error message to simple text.
