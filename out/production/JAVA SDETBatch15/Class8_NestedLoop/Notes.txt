Loops help us repeat instructions in code for example if we have to print the numbers from 1 to 100 one way
we can do this is by copying and pasting the code which is bad and not scalable other way of doing this is
using loops.
There are 4 types of loops:
    1)while
    2)do while
    3) for loop
    4) enhanced for loop.
break keyword:
    break keyword is used to stop a loop just like the condition that we use inside a loop.
Continue:
    is used to skip all the code written inside the body of the loop.
we should always use break and continue with if conditions
