Set:
    Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are three main types of sets
     1)HashSet 2)LinkedHashSet 3)TreeSet
HashSet(most widely used):
    Upside: Speed it's the fastest
    downside: It does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
            Upside: maintains the insertion order.
            Downside:  Slower than HashSet
TreeSet:
    Upside: keeps the data sorted
    Downside: it's slower than all.
Map:
Map is the collection of entry object, entry object are that store key and value. we use map
 to stor pairs of object.
    Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. (by using Put Keyword) Just like Sets we
    have three main types of maps as well.
    1) HashMap
    2) LinkedHashMap
    3) TreeMap
HashMap(most widely used):
    Upside: Speed it's the fastest
    downside: It does not maintain the insertion order.
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: maintains the insertion order.
    Downside:  Slower than HashSet
TreeMap:
             Upside: keeps the data sorted
             Downside: it's slower than all.
