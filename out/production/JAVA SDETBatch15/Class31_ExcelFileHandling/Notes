If we have to read the data from a file manually on our computers what do we need?
    1) We need to know where the file is stored on our computer
    2) we need to navigate to that folder
    3) A software that understands how the data is stored in those files.
Why do we need .properties file:
    we use these file to store information like usernames password URLS database connection etc.
    so that this information is secured and is not pushed with code on GitHub.
